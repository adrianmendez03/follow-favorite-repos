# Motivation
The purpose of this repo was to create a tool with which   
someone can track easily changes of his favorite opensource repo

# More About: What Is Behind Of This Repo
I think that one way(among many others) to measure the programmer level - is by looking at his/her contributions to opensource.  

## Why?
* Because you actually can see the code he/she wrote not under pressure
* Because you actually can see he/she knows how to work with git
* Because for contirbuting to some popular repo you need to learn about project and its contributing-code in depth...  
  
That is why it may be important to follow the repo you-want-to-contribute closely
